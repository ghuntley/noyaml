# Made with 💖 by https://ghuntley.com after one too many CustomResourceDefinitions

                    - YAML

# 🤔 Why YAML is the right devops technology for you 🤔
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime "panic at the disco" in production is dope
# - "something broke" is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, "used by kubernetes"
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1][2], YAML supports comments
# - no official documentation (other than a specification for implementers) is totally fine
# - you need a super safe way to "execute this code"

# 🍿 wait a sec, did you say "executable yaml"?? 🍿

# 🚨 Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway 🚨
# `NO` is parsed as a boolean type, which with the YAML 1.1 spec, there are 22 options to write "true" or "false."
# You have to wrap "NO" in quotes to get the expected result.
NI: Nicaragua
NL: Netherlands
NO: Norway # 💣!

# 🚨 Anyone wondering why their first seven Kubernetes clusters deploy just fine, and the eighth fails? 🚨
- 07
- 08
# Results in
[ 7, "08" ]

# YAML knows that, when you have something that looks like the time of day,
# what you _really_ wanted is the time of seconds since midnight
timeOfDay:
  whatYouWrote: 04:30 # And when you parse this file and serialize it again, you get ...
  whatYouSurelyMeant: 16200 # Have fun debugging this one!
  whatYouShouldHaveWritten: !!str 04:30

# YAML is the super best way to encode Octal (tm) and learning the hard way that Kubernetes uses YAML 1.1
# is a DevOps rite of passage. Below YAML 1.2 a large integer is automatically converted to octal.[3]
- YAML 1.1 uses `0666` notation.
- YAML 1.2 uses `0o666` notation

# 🤢 I have recently been learning GitHub Actions
#
# I just made 8 commits/pushes in one hour, and the last commit message, in its entirety, was:

# "I don't really like yml"

# Speaking of CI, did you know that 8-character SHAs could be all numbers?
# If the system that parses `my.flaky_version` is typed, it will happily explode 2% of the time.
my:

# If you're building a YAML file for Cloudformation for a DashboardBody for Cloudwatch

- The problem with YAML they did one thing well. Shitty boiler plate. Then everyone thought it was a good idea.

# 📖 Footnotes 📖
# [1] You can do comments in json by `{"//": "A way to use comments in json"}` but it's icky.
# [2] "Does ansible have a json schema? Yaml aint so bad with a schema."?
# [3] Also see `python2 -c 'print 011' && echo $((011 + 1))`
	
# and finally, here's some ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ feedback from reddit.com:
- I need to burn the very motherboard this site runs from. It’s that awful.
- This is the worst website I've ever seen
- I agree with the author in principle but that website is inexcusable. I'm going to add YAML config to my projects on Monday just to spite that horrific "website".
- Wtf is this website and why does it repeatedly pop up my phone's keyboard
    - This Website is a giant editable textfield
        - Why?!?
            - Because it’s a good idea to demonstrate good standards while standing on one’s soapbox
                - The author of THAT website wants to tell the rest of us how to program.
- While I agree with the spirit of the website (fuck yaml), the design decisions of the author are questionable to say the least.
- The good news (I realised) was that you can select all the text of the site, and then delete it. Problem solved.
- Fuck this website. Maybe if this person stopped bitching about yaml their website wouldn't blow.
- Yeah, I’m not going to take advice on best practices from a guy whose website is a giant editable text field with unclickable hyperlinks.

# ps. By design, this website is as usable as YAML. 💕
